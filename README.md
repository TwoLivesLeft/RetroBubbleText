#  Retro Bubble Text

This is a simple effect used in [Retrogram](https://retrogram.app) which renders text with a fun bubble-style outline in SwiftUI

You can use it like this: `RetroBubbleText(text: "Retrogram", size: 62, style: .large)`

There are three styles (`.large`, `.small` and `.tiny`). I found these were necessary in practice as different fonts could show artifacts at different sizes, and for different letters
